# Escape key:
# All screen commands are prefixed by an escape key, by default C-a
# (that's Control-a, sometimes written ^a). To send a literal C-a
# to the programs in screen, use C-a a. This is useful when when working with
# screen within screen. For example C-a a n will move screen to a new window
# on the screen within screen.
