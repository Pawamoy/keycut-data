- action: Scroll the process list.
  keys: [Up, Down, Left, Right, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End]
- action: >
    Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
    like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes,
    instead of the currently highlighted one.
  keys: [Space]
- action: Untag all processes (remove all tags added with the Space key).
  keys: [U]
- action: >
    Trace process system calls: if strace(1) is installed,
    pressing this key will attach it to the currently selected process,
    presenting a live update of system calls issued by the process.
  keys: [s]
- action: >
    Display open files for a process: if lsof(1) is installed, pressing
    this key will display the list of file descriptors opened by the process.
  keys: [l]
- action: Go to the help screen.
  keys: [F1, h, '?']
- action: >
    Go to the setup screen, where you can configure the meters displayed
    at the top of the screen, set various display options, choose among
    color schemes, and select which columns are displayed, in which order.
  keys: [F2, S]
- action: >
    Incrementally search the command lines of all the displayed processes.
    The currently selected (highlighted) command will update as you type.
    While in search mode, pressing F3 will cycle through matching occurrences.
  keys: [F3, /]
- action: >
    Incremental process filtering: type in part of a process command line
    and only processes whose names match will be shown. To cancel filtering,
    enter the Filter option again and press Esc.
  keys: [F4, '\']
- action: >
    Tree view: organize processes by parenthood, and layout the relations
    between them as a tree. Toggling the key will switch between tree and your
    previously selected sort view. Selecting a sort view will exit tree view.
  keys: [F5, t]
- action: >
    Select a field for sorting. The current sort field
    is indicated by a highlight in the header.
  keys: [F6, '<', '>']
- action: >
    Increase the selected process's priority (subtract from 'nice' value).
    This can only be done by the superuser.
  keys: [F7, ']']
- action: Decrease the selected process's priority (add to 'nice' value).
  keys: [F8, '[']
- action: >
    Kill process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group
    of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged
    processes. If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
  keys: [F9, k]
- action: Quit.
  keys: [F10, q]
- action: >
    Invert the sort order: if sort order is increasing,
    switch to decreasing, and vice-versa.
  keys: [I]
- action: >
    When in tree view mode, expand or collapse subtree. When a subtree
    is collapsed a "+" sign shows to the left of the process name.
  keys: [+, -]
- action: >
    Set CPU affinity: mark which CPUs a process is allowed to use
    (on multiprocessor machines).
  keys: [a]
- action: Show only processes owned by a specified user.
  keys: [u]
- action: Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key).
  keys: [M]
- action: Sort by processor usage (top compatibility key).
  keys: [P]
- action: Sort by time (top compatibility key).
  keys: [T]
- action: >
    "Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process
    to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for
    monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on
    screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
  keys: [F]
- action: >
    Hide kernel threads: prevent the threads belonging the kernel
    to be displayed in the process list (this is a toggle key).
  keys: [K]
- action: >
    Hide user threads: on systems that represent them differently than ordinary
    processes (such as recent NPTL-based systems), this can hide threads from
    userspace processes in the process list (this is a toggle key).
  keys: [H]
- action: >
    Refresh: redraw screen and recalculate values.
  keys: [Ctrl-l]
- action: >
    PID search: type in process ID
    and the selection highlight will be moved to it.
  keys: [Numbers]
